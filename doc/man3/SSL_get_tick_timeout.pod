=head1 NAME

SSL_get_tick_timeout - determine when an SSL object next needs to be ticked

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 __owur int SSL_get_tick_timeout(SSL *s, struct timeval *tv);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_get_tick_timeout() determines when the SSL object next needs to perform
internal processing due to the passage of time. It is currently applicable only
to DTLS and QUIC connection SSL objects, and is not supported on other kinds of
SSL object.

Calling SSL_get_tick_timeout() results in B<*tv> being written with an amount of
time left before the SSL object needs to be ticked. If the SSL object needs to
be ticked immediately, it is set to zero; if the SSL object currently does not
need to be ticked at any point in the future, B<tv_sec> is set to -1,
representing infinity.

Note that the value output by a call to SSL_get_tick_timeout() may change as a
result of other calls to the SSL object.

Once the timeout expires, SSL_tick() should be called to handle any internal
processing which is due; for more information, see L<SSL_tick(3)>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
